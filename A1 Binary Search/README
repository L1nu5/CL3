Use Divide and Conquer Strategies and object-oriented software design technique
using Modelio to design software function for Binary Search for an un-ordered data
stored in memory. Use necessary USE-CASE diagrams and justify its use with the help
of mathematical modeling and related efficiency such as space and time complexity.
Give the design with class and sequence diagrams. 
Implement the design using Eclipse C++ or Python.
